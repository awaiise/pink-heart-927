My love,

From the moment you came into my life,
everything started to feel right.
You became my happiness,
my peace, and my safe place.

Every smile of yours
means the world to me,
and every moment with you
is a memory I will always treasure.

On your birthday today,
I just want you to know
how deeply I love you.

You are my today,
my tomorrow,
and my forever. ❤️
